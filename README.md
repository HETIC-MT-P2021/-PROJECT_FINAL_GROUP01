# Dimo


Dimo is a bot for playing the Word String game on Discord. There is an order to follow in order to play. The game is played only in multiplayer (2 to 5 players). The order of players is defined by the order of arrival of each player in the game. One of the players enters a word. The next player continues with another word starting with the last letter of the previous word. The next one goes on and so on.
